The  people  of  India  have  reposed  their  faith  in  the  government  led  by   the  Hon’ble  Prime  Minister  Shri  Narendra  Modi  and  re-elected  it  for  a  historic   third  term  under  his  leadership.  We  are  grateful  for  their  support,  faith  and   trust  in  our  policies.  We  are  determined  to  ensure  that  all  Indians,  regardless   of  religion,  caste,  gender  and  age,  make  substantial  progress  in  realising  their   life  goals  and  aspirations.   \\nGlobal  Context   \\n2.  The  global  economy,  while  performing  better  than  expected,  is  still  in   the  grip  of  policy  uncertainties.  Elevated  asset  prices,  political  uncertainties   and  shipping  disruptions  continue  to  pose  significant  downside  risks  for   growth  and  upside  risks  to  inflation.    \\n3.  In  this  context,  India’s  economic  growth  continues  to  be  the  shining   exception  and  will  remain  so  in  the  years  ahead.  India’s  inflation  continues  to   be  low,  stable  and  moving  towards  the  4  per  cent  target.  Core  inflation  (non  food,  non-fuel)  currently  is  3.1  per  cent.  Steps  are  being  taken  to  ensure   supplies  of  perishable  goods  reach  market  adequately.'),\n",

This  scheme  will  incentivize  additional  employment  in  the   manufacturing  sector,  linked  to  the  employment  of  first-time  employees.  An   incentive  will  be  provided  at  specified  scale  directly  both  to  the  employee   and  the  employer  with  respect  to  their  EPFO  contribution  in  the  first  4  years   of  employment.  The  scheme  is  expected  to  benefit  30  lakh  youth  entering   employment,  and  their  employers.    \\nScheme  C:  Support  to  employers    \\n22.

E-vouchers  for  this  purpose  will  be  given  directly  to  1  lakh  students  every   year  for  annual  interest  subvention  of  3  per  cent  of  the  loan  amount.    \\nPriority  3:  Inclusive  Human  Resource  Development  and  Social  Justice  \\nSaturation  approach    \\n27.  Our  government  is  committed  to  all-round,  all-pervasive  and  all  inclusive  development  of  people,  particularly,  farmers,  youth,  women  and   poor.  For  achieving  social  justice  comprehensively,  the  saturation  approach   of  covering  all  eligible  people  through  various  programmes  including  those   for  education  and  health  will  be  adopted  to  empower  them  by  improving   their  capabilities.    \\n28.

For  promoting  women-led  development,  the  budget  carries  an   allocation  of  more  than  `  3  lakh  crore  for  schemes  benefitting  women  and   girls.  This  signals  our  government’s  commitment  for  enhancing  women’s  role   in  economic  development.    \\nPradhan  Mantri  Janjatiya  Unnat  Gram  Abhiyan    \\n39.  For  improving  the  socio-economic  condition  of  tribal  communities,  we   will  launch  the  Pradhan  Mantri  Janjatiya  Unnat  Gram  Abhiyan  by  adopting   saturation  coverage  for  tribal  families  in  tribal-majority  villages  and   aspirational  districts.

More  than  100  branches  of  India  Post  Payment  Bank  will  be  set  up  in   the  North  East  region  to  expand  the  banking  services.    \\n41.  This  year,  I  have  made  a  provision  of  `  2.66  lakh  crore  for  rural   development  including  rural  infrastructure.    \\nPriority  4:  Manufacturing  &  Services   \\nSupport  for  promotion  of  MSMEs   \\n42.  This  budget  provides  special  attention  to  MSMEs  and  manufacturing,   particularly  labour-intensive  manufacturing.  We  have  formulated  a  package   covering  financing,  regulatory  changes  and  technology  support  for  MSMEs  to   help  them  grow  and  also  compete  globally,  as  mentioned  in  the  interim   budget.

The  scheme  will  operate  on  pooling  of  credit  risks   of  such  MSMEs.  A  separately  constituted  self-financing  guarantee  fund  will   provide,  to  each  applicant,  guarantee  cover  up  to  `  100  crore,  while  the  loan   amount  may  be  larger.  The  borrower  will  have  to  provide  an  upfront   guarantee  fee  and  an  annual  guarantee  fee  on  the  reducing  loan  balance.    \\nNew  assessment  model  for  MSME  credit   \\n44.  Public  sector  banks  will  build  their  in-house  capability  to  assess   MSMEs  for  credit,  instead  of  relying  on  external  assessment.  They  will  also   take  a  lead  in  developing  or  getting  developed  a  new  credit  assessment   model,  based  on  the  scoring  of  digital  footprints  of  MSMEs  in  the  economy.   This  is  expected  to  be  a  significant  improvement  over  the  traditional   assessment  of  credit  eligibility  based  only  on  asset  or  turnover  criteria.  That   will  also  cover  MSMEs  without  a  formal  accounting  system.   \\nCredit  Support  to  MSMEs  during  Stress  Period   \\n45.  I  am  happy  to  announce  a  new  mechanism  for  facilitating   continuation  of  bank  credit  to  MSMEs  during  their  stress  period.  While  being   in  the  ‘special  mention  account’  (SMA)  stage  for  reasons  beyond  their   control,  MSMEs  need  credit  to  continue  their  business  and  to  avoid  getting   into  the  NPA  stage.  Credit  availability  will  be  supported  through  a  guarantee   from  a  government  promoted  fund.    \\nMudra  Loans   \\n46.  The  limit  of  Mudra  loans  will  be  enhanced  to  ₹  20  lakh  from  the   current  ₹  10  lakh  for  those  entrepreneurs  who  have  availed  and  successfully   repaid  previous  loans  under  the  ‘Tarun’  category.   \\nEnhanced  scope  for  mandatory  onboarding  in  TReDS   \\n47.  For  facilitating  MSMEs  to  unlock  their  working  capital  by  converting   their  trade  receivables  into  cash,  I  propose  to  reduce  the  turnover  threshold   of  buyers  for  mandatory  onboarding  on  the  TReDS  platform  from  `  500  crore   to  `  250  crore.  This  measure  will  bring  22  more  CPSEs  and  7000  more   10   \\ncompanies  onto  the  platform.  Medium  enterprises  will  also  be  included  in   the  scope  of  the  suppliers.   \\nSIDBI  branches  in  MSME  clusters   \\n48.  SIDBI  will  open  new  branches  to  expand  its  reach  to  serve  all  major   MSME  clusters  within  3  years,  and  provide  direct  credit  to  them.  With  the   opening  of  24  such  branches  this  year,  the  service  coverage  will  expand  to   168  out  of  242  major  clusters.    \\nMSME  Units  for  Food  Irradiation,  Quality  &  Safety  Testing'),\n",

To  enable  MSMEs  and  traditional  artisans  to  sell  their  products  in   international  markets,  E-Commerce  Export  Hubs  will  be  set  up  in  public  private-partnership  (PPP)  mode  .  These  hubs,  under  a  seamless  regulatory   and  logistic  framework,  will  facilitate  trade  and  export  related  services  under   one  roof.    \\nMeasures  for  promotion  of  Manufacturing  &  Services    \\nInternship  in  Top  Companies   51.  As  the  5\\n th  \\nscheme  under  the  Prime  Minister’s  package,  our   government  will  launch  a  comprehensive  scheme  for  providing  internship   opportunities  in  500  top  companies  to  1  crore  youth  in  5  years.

We  will  formulate  an  Economic  Policy  Framework  to  delineate  the   overarching  approach  to  economic  development  and  set  the  scope  of  the   next  generation  of  reforms  for  facilitating  employment  opportunities  and   sustaining  high  growth.    \\n96.  Our  government  will  initiate  and  incentivize  reforms  for  (1)  improving   productivity  of  factors  of  production,  and  (2)  facilitating  markets  and  sectors   to  become  more  efficient.  These  reforms  will  cover  all  factors  of  production,   18   \\nnamely  land,  labour,  capital  and  entrepreneurship,  and  technology  as  an   enabler  of  improving  total  factor  productivity  and  bridging  inequality.    \\n97.  Effective  implementation  of  several  of  these  reforms  requires   collaboration  between  the  Centre  and  the  states  and  building  consensus,  as   development  of  the  country  lies  in  development  of  the  states.  For  promoting   competitive  federalism  and  incentivizing  states  for  faster  implementation  of   reforms,  I  propose  to  earmark  a  significant  part  of  the  50-year  interest-free   loan.  Working  with  the  states,  we  will  initiate  the  following  reforms.    \\nLand-related  reforms  by  state  governments   \\n98.  Land-related  reforms  and  actions,  both  in  rural  and  urban  areas,  will   cover  (1)  land  administration,  planning  and  management,  and  (2)  urban   planning,  usage  and  building  bylaws.  These  will  be  incentivized  for   completion  within  the  next  3  years  through  appropriate  fiscal  support.    \\nRural  Land  related  actions   \\n99.  Rural  land  related  actions  will  include  (1)  assignment  of  Unique  Land   Parcel  Identification  Number  (ULPIN)  or  Bhu-Aadhaar  for  all  lands,  (2)   digitization  of  cadastral  maps,  (3)  survey  of  map  sub-divisions  as  per  current   ownership,  (4)  establishment  of  land  registry,  and  (5)  linking  to  the  farmers   registry.  These  actions  will  also  facilitate  credit  flow  and  other  agricultural'),\n",

Land  records  in  urban  areas  will  be  digitized  with  GIS  mapping.  An  IT   based  system  for  property  record  administration,  updating,  and  tax   administration  will  be  established.  These  will  also  facilitate  improving  the   financial  position  of  urban  local  bodies.    \\nLabour  related  reforms   \\nServices  to  Labour   \\n101.  Our  government  will  facilitate  the  provision  of  a  wide  array  of  services   to  labour,  including  those  for  employment  and  skilling.  A  comprehensive   integration  of  e-shram  portal  with  other  portals  will  facilitate  such  one-stop   solution.  Open  architecture  databases  for  the  rapidly  changing  labour   19   \\nmarket,  skill  requirements  and  available  job  roles,  and  a  mechanism  to   connect  job-aspirants  with  potential  employers  and  skill  providers  will  be   covered  in  these  services.    \\nShram  Suvidha  &  Samadhan  Portal   \\n102.  Shram  Suvidha  and  Samadhan  portals  will  be  revamped  to  enhance   ease  of  compliance  for  industry  and  trade.    \\nCapital  and  entrepreneurship  related  reforms   \\nFinancial  sector  vision  and  strategy   \\n103.  For  meeting  financing  needs  of  the  economy,  our  government  will   bring  out  a  financial  sector  vision  and  strategy  document  to  prepare  the   sector  in  terms  of  size,  capacity  and  skills.  This  will  set  the  agenda  for  the   next  5  years  and  guide  the  work  of  the  government,  regulators,  financial   institutions  and  market  participants.    \\nTaxonomy  for  climate  finance    \\n104.  We  will  develop  a  taxonomy  for  climate  finance  for  enhancing  the   availability  of  capital  for  climate  adaptation  and  mitigation.  This  will  support   achievement  of  the  country’s  climate  commitments  and  green  transition.    \\nVariable  Capital  Company  structure    \\n105.  We  will  seek  the  required  legislative  approval  for  providing  an   efficient  and  flexible  mode  for  financing  leasing  of  aircrafts  and  ships,  and   pooled  funds  of  private  equity  through  a  ‘variable  company  structure’.    \\nForeign  Direct  Investment  and  Overseas  Investment   \\n106.

NPS-Vatsalya,  a  plan  for  contribution  by  parents  and  guardians  for   minors  will  be  started.  On  attaining  the  age  of  majority,  the  plan  can  be   converted  seamlessly  into  a  normal  NPS  account.  20   \\nUse  of  Technology    \\n108.  We  have  successfully  used  technology  for  improving  productivity  and   bridging  inequality  in  our  economy  during  the  past  10  years.  Public   investment  in  digital  infrastructure  and  innovations  by  the  private  sector   have  helped  in  improving  access  of  all  citizens,  particularly  the  common   people,  to  market  resources,  education,  health  and  services.  We  will  step  up   adoption  of  technology  towards  digitalization  of  the  economy.    \\nEase  of  Doing  Business   \\n109.  For  enhancing  ‘Ease  of  Doing  Business’,  we  are  already  working  on  the   Jan  Vishwas  Bill  2.0.  Further,  states  will  be  incentivized  for  implementation  of   their  Business  Reforms  Action  Plans  and  digitalization.   \\nData  and  Statistics   \\n110.  For  improving  data  governance,  collection,  processing  and   management  of  data  and  statistics,  different  sectoral  data  bases,  including   those  established  under  the  Digital  India  mission,  will  be  utilized  with  active   use  of  technology  tools.    \\nNew  Pension  Scheme  (NPS)    \\n111.  The  Committee  to  review  the  NPS  has  made  considerable  progress  in   its  work.  I  am  happy  that  the  Staff  Side  of  the  National  Council  of  the  Joint   Consultative  Machinery  for  Central  Government  Employees  have  taken  a   constructive  approach.  A  solution  will  be  evolved  which  addresses  the   relevant  issues  while  maintaining  fiscal  prudence  to  protect  the  common   citizens.   \\nBudget  Estimates  2024-25   \\n112.  For  the  year  2024-25,  the  total  receipts  other  than  borrowings  and   the  total  expenditure  are  estimated  at  `  32.07  lakh  crore  and  `  48.21  lakh   crore  respectively.  The  net  tax  receipts  are  estimated  at  `  25.83  lakh  crore.   The  fiscal  deficit  is  estimated  at  4.9  per  cent  of  GDP.'),\n",

Both  will  be  less  than  that  in  2023-24.    \\n114.  The  fiscal  consolidation  path  announced  by  me  in  2021  has  served  our   economy  very  well,  and  we  aim  to  reach  a  deficit  below  4.5  per  cent  next   year.  The  Government  is  committed  to  staying  the  course.  From  2026-27   onwards,  our  endeavour  will  be  to  keep  the  fiscal  deficit  each  year  such  that   the  Central  Government  debt  will  be  on  a  declining  path  as  percentage  of   GDP.    \\nI  will,  now,  move  to  Part  B.  22   \\nPART  B   \\nIndirect  Taxes   \\n115.  I  start  with  GST.  It  has  decreased  tax  incidence  on  the  common  man;   reduced  compliance  burden  and  logistics  cost  for  trade  and  industry;  and   enhanced  revenues  of  the  central  and  state  governments.  It  is  a  success  of   vast  proportions.  To  multiply  the  benefits  of  GST,  we  will  strive  to  further   simplify  and  rationalise  the  tax  structure  and  endeavour  to  expand  it  to  the   remaining  sectors.   \\n116.  My  proposals  for  customs  duties  intend  to  support  domestic   manufacturing,  deepen  local  value  addition,  promote  export   competitiveness,  and  simplify  taxation,  while  keeping  the  interest  of  the   general  public  and  consumers  surmount.   \\n117.  In  Budget  2022-23,  we  reduced  the  number  of  customs  duty  rates.   I  propose  to  undertake  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  rate  structure  over  the   next  six  months  to  rationalise  and  simplify  it  for  ease  of  trade,  removal  of   duty  inversion  and  reduction  of  disputes.   \\n118.  I  shall  now  take  up  sector  specific  customs  duty  proposals.  \\nMedicines  and  Medical  Equipment   \\n119.  To  provide  relief  to  cancer  patients,  I  propose  to  fully  exempt  three   more  medicines  from  customs  duties.   \\n120.  I  also  propose  changes  in  the  BCD  on  x-ray  tubes  &  flat  panel   detectors  for  use  in  medical  x-ray  machines  under  the  Phased  Manufacturing   Programme,  so  as  to  synchronise  them  with  domestic  capacity  addition.   \\nMobile  Phone  and  Related  Parts'),\n",

With  a  three-fold  increase  in  domestic  production  and  almost   100-fold  jump  in  exports  of  mobile  phones  over  the  last  six  years,  the  Indian  mobile  phone  industry  has  matured.  In  the  interest  of  consumers,  I  now   propose  to  reduce  the  BCD  on  mobile  phone,  mobile  PCBA  and  mobile   charger  to  15  per  cent.  23   \\nCritical  Minerals   \\n122.  Minerals  such  as  lithium,  copper,  cobalt  and  rare  earth  elements  are   critical  for  sectors  like  nuclear  energy,  renewable  energy,  space,  defence,   telecommunications,  and  high-tech  electronics.  I  propose  to  fully  exempt   customs  duties  on  25  critical  minerals  and  reduce  BCD  on  two  of  them.  This   will  provide  a  major  fillip  to  the  processing  and  refining  of  such  minerals  and   help  secure  their  availability  for  these  strategic  and  important  sectors.    \\nSolar  Energy    \\n123.  Energy  transition  is  critical  in  the  fight  against  climate  change.  To   support  energy  transition,  I  propose  to  expand  the  list  of  exempted  capital   goods  for  use  in  the  manufacture  of  solar  cells  and  panels  in  the  country.   Further,  in  view  of  sufficient  domestic  manufacturing  capacity  of  solar  glass   and  tinned  copper  interconnect,  I  propose  not  to  extend  the  exemption  of   customs  duties  provided  to  them.   \\nMarine  products   \\n124.  India’s  seafood  exports  in  the  last  financial  year  touched  an  all-time   high  of  more  than  ₹  60,000  crore.  Frozen  shrimp  accounted  for  about   two-thirds  of  these  exports.  To  enhance  their  competitiveness,  I  propose  to   reduce  BCD  on  certain  broodstock,  polychaete  worms,  shrimp  and  fish  feed   to  5  per  cent.  I  also  propose  to  exempt  customs  duty  on  various  inputs  for   manufacture  of  shrimp  and  fish  feed.   \\nLeather  and  Textile    \\n125.  Similarly,  to  enhance  the  competitiveness  of  exports  in  the  leather   and  textile  sectors,  I  propose  to  reduce  BCD  on  real  down  filling  material   from  duck  or  goose.  I  am  also  making  additions  to  the  list  of  exempted  goods   for  manufacture  of  leather  and  textile  garments,  footwear  and  other  leather   articles  for  export.    \\n126.  To  rectify  inversion  in  duty,  I  propose  to  reduce  BCD,  subject  to   conditions,  on  methylene  diphenyl  diisocyanate  (MDI)  for  manufacture  of   spandex  yarn  from  7.5  to  5  per  cent.  24'),\n",

Furthermore,  the  export  duty  structure  on  raw  hides,  skins  and   leather  is  proposed  to  be  simplified  and  rationalized.   \\nPrecious  Metals   \\n128.  To  enhance  domestic  value  addition  in  gold  and  precious  metal   jewellery  in  the  country,  I  propose  to  reduce  customs  duties  on  gold  and   silver  to  6  per  cent  and  that  on  platinum  to  6.4  per  cent.    \\nOther  Metals   \\n129.  Steel  and  copper  are  important  raw  materials.  To  reduce  their  cost  of   production,  I  propose  to  remove  the  BCD  on  ferro  nickel  and  blister  copper.  I   am  also  continuing  with  nil  BCD  on  ferrous  scrap  and  nickel  cathode  and   concessional  BCD  of  2.5  per  cent  on  copper  scrap.   \\nElectronics    \\n130.  To  increase  value  addition  in  the  domestic  electronics  industry,   I  propose  to  remove  the  BCD,  subject  to  conditions,  on  oxygen  free  copper   for  manufacture  of  resistors.  I  also  propose  to  exempt  certain  parts  for   manufacture  of  connectors.   \\nChemicals  and  Petrochemicals    \\n131.  To  support  existing  and  new  capacities  in  the  pipeline,  I  propose  to   increase  the  BCD  on  ammonium  nitrate  from  7.5  to  10  per  cent.   \\nPlastics   \\n132.  PVC  flex  banners  are  non-biodegradable  and  hazardous  for   environment  and  health.  To  curb  their  imports,  I  propose  to  raise  the  BCD  on   them  from  10  to  25  per  cent.   \\nTelecommunication  Equipment   \\n133.  To  incentivise  domestic  manufacturing,  I  propose  to  increase  the  BCD   from  10  to  15  per  cent  on  PCBA  of  specified  telecom  equipment.    \\nTrade  facilitation   \\n134.  To  promote  domestic  aviation  and  boat  &  ship  MRO,  I  propose  to   extend  the  period  for  export  of  goods  imported  for  repairs  from  six  months   to  one  year.  In  the  same  vein,  I  propose  to  extend  the  time-limit  for  re-import   of  goods  for  repairs  under  warranty  from  three  to  five  years.  25   \\nDirect  Taxes   \\n135.

It  has  been  our  endeavour  to  simplify  taxation.  We  have  taken  a   number  of  measures  in  the  last  few  years  including  introduction  of  simplified   tax  regimes  without  exemptions  and  deductions  for  corporate  tax  and   personal  income  tax.  This  has  been  appreciated  by  tax  payers.  58  per  cent  of   corporate  tax  came  from  the  simplified  tax  regime  in  financial  year  2022-23.   Similarly,  as  per  data  available  till  now  for  the  last  fiscal,  more  than  two  thirds  have  availed  the  new  personal  income  tax  regime.   \\nComprehensive  Review  of  the  Income-tax  Act,  1961   \\n137.  I  am  now  announcing  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  Income-tax  Act,   1961.  The  purpose  is  to  make  the  Act  concise,  lucid,  easy  to  read  and   understand.  This  will  reduce  disputes  and  litigation,  thereby  providing  tax   certainty  to  the  tax  payers.  It  will  also  bring  down  the  demand  embroiled  in   litigation.  It  is  proposed  to  be  completed  in  six  months.   \\n138.  A  beginning  is  being  made  in  the  Finance  Bill  by  simplifying  the  tax   regime  for  charities,  TDS  rate  structure,  provisions  for  reassessment  and   search  provisions  and  capital  gains  taxation.   \\nSimplification  for  Charities  and  of  TDS   \\n139.  The  two  tax  exemption  regimes  for  charities  are  proposed  to  be   merged  into  one.  The  5  per  cent  TDS  rate  on  many  payments  is  being  merged   into  the  2  per  cent  TDS  rate  and  the  20  per  cent  TDS  rate  on  repurchase  of  units  by  mutual  funds  or  UTI  is  being  withdrawn.  TDS  rate  on  e-commerce   operators  is  proposed  to  be  reduced  from  one  to  0.1  per  cent.  Moreover,   credit  of  TCS  is  proposed  to  be  given  in  the  TDS  to  be  deducted  on  salary.   Further,  I  propose  to  decriminalize  delay  for  payment  of  TDS  up  to  the  due   date  of  filing  statement  for  the  same.  I  also  plan  to  provide  a  standard   operating  procedure  for  TDS  defaults  and  simplify  and  rationalise  the   compounding  guidelines  for  such  defaults.  26   \\nSimplification  of  Reassessment   \\n140.  I  propose  to  thoroughly  simplify  the  provisions  for  reopening  and   reassessment.  An  assessment  hereinafter  can  be  reopened  beyond  three   years  from  the  end  of  the  assessment  year  only  if  the  escaped  income  is   ₹  50  lakh  or  more,  up  to  a  maximum  period  of  five  years  from  the  end  of  the   assessment  year.  Even  in  search  cases,  a  time  limit  of  six  years  before  the   year  of  search,  as  against  the  existing  time  limit  of  ten  years,  is  proposed.   This  will  reduce  tax-uncertainty  and  disputes.   \\nSimplification  and  Rationalisation  of  Capital  Gains    \\n141.  Capital  gains  taxation  is  also  proposed  to  be  hugely  simplified.    \\n142.  Short  term  gains  on  certain  financial  assets  shall  henceforth  attract  a   tax  rate  of  20  per  cent,  while  that  on  all  other  financial  assets  and  all'),\n",

Long  term  gains  on  all  financial  and  non-financial  assets,  on  the  other   hand,  will  attract  a  tax  rate  of  12.5  per  cent.  For  the  benefit  of  the  lower  and   middle-income  classes,  I  propose  to  increase  the  limit  of  exemption  of  capital   gains  on  certain  financial  assets  to  ₹  1.25  lakh  per  year.   \\n144.  Listed  financial  assets  held  for  more  than  a  year  will  be  classified  as   long  term,  while  unlisted  financial  assets  and  all  non-financial  assets  will  have   to  be  held  for  at  least  two  years  to  be  classified  as  long-term.    \\n145.  Unlisted  bonds  and  debentures,  debt  mutual  funds  and  market  linked   debentures,  irrespective  of  holding  period,  however,  will  attract  tax  on   capital  gains  at  applicable  rates.   \\nTax  Payer  Services   \\n146.  All  the  major  tax  payer  services  under  GST  and  most  services  under   Customs  and  Income  Tax  have  been  digitalised.  All  remaining  services  of   Customs  and  Income  Tax  including  rectification  and  order  giving  effect  to   appellate  orders  shall  be  digitalized  and  made  paper-less  over  the  next  two   years.   \\nLitigation  and  Appeals   \\n147.  While  our  concerted  efforts  to  reduce  pendency  of  appeals  at  various   appellate  fora  are  beginning  to  show  good  results,  it  will  continue  to  engage   our  highest  attention.  27   \\n148.  To  dispose  of  the  backlog  of  first  appeals,  I  plan  to  deploy  more   officers  to  hear  and  decide  such  appeals,  especially  those  with  large  tax   effect.    \\n149.  For  resolution  of  certain  income  tax  disputes  pending  in  appeal,  I  am   also  proposing  Vivad  Se  Vishwas  Scheme,  2024.    \\n150.  Further,  I  propose  to  increase  monetary  limits  for  filing  appeals   related  to  direct  taxes,  excise  and  service  tax  in  the  Tax  Tribunals,  High  Courts   and  Supreme  Court  to  ₹  60  lakh,  ₹  2  crore  and  ₹  5  crore  respectively.   \\n151.  With  a  view  to  reduce  litigation  and  provide  certainty  in  international   taxation,  we  will  expand  the  scope  of  safe  harbour  rules  and  make  them   more  attractive.  We  will  also  streamline  the  transfer  pricing  assessment   procedure.   \\nEmployment  and  Investment   \\n152.  I  have  a  few  proposals  to  promote  investment  and  foster   employment.    \\n153.  First  of  all,  to  bolster  the  Indian  start-up  eco-system,  boost  the   entrepreneurial  spirit  and  support  innovation,  I  propose  to  abolish  the  so  called  angel  tax  for  all  classes  of  investors.   \\n154.

Fourth,  to  attract  foreign  capital  for  our  development  needs,   I  propose  to  reduce  the  corporate  tax  rate  on  foreign  companies  from  40  to   35  per  cent.   28   \\nDeepening  the  tax  base   \\n157.

First,  Security   Transactions  Tax  on  futures  and  options  of  securities  is  proposed  to  be   increased  to  0.02  per  cent  and  0.1  per  cent  respectively.  Second,  for  reasons   of  equity,  I  propose  to  tax  income  received  on  buy  back  of  shares  in  the   hands  of  the  recipient.    \\nOthers   \\n158.  To  improve  social  security  benefits,  deduction  of  expenditure  by   employers  towards  NPS  is  proposed  to  be  increased  from  10  to  14  per  cent  of   the  employee’s  salary.  Similarly,  deduction  of  this  expenditure  up  to  14  per   cent  of  salary  from  the  income  of  employees  in  private  sector,  public  sector   banks  and  undertakings,  opting  for  the  new  tax  regime,  is  proposed  to  be   provided.   \\n159.  Indian  professionals  working  in  multinationals  get  ESOPs  and  invest  in   social  security  schemes  and  other  movable  assets  abroad.  Non-reporting  of   such  small  foreign  assets  has  penal  consequences  under  the  Black  Money   Act.  Such  non-reporting  of  movable  assets  up  to  ₹  20  lakh  is  proposed  to  be   de-penalised.   \\n160.  Other  major  proposals  in  the  Finance  Bill  relate  to:   \\n•\\n \\nWithdrawal\\n \\nof\\n \\nequalization\\n \\nlevy\\n \\nof\\n \\n2\\n \\nper\\n \\ncent;\\n \\n \\n•\\n \\nExpansion\\n \\nof\\n \\ntax\\n \\nbenefits\\n \\nto\\n \\ncertain\\n \\nfunds\\n \\nand\\n \\nentities\\n \\nin\\n \\nIFSCs;\\n \\nand\\n \\n \\n•\\n \\nimmunity\\n \\nfrom\\n \\npenalty\\n \\nand\\n \\nprosecution\\n \\nto\\n \\nbenamidar\\n \\non\\n \\nfull\\n \\nand\\n  \\ntrue\\n disclosure  so  as  to  improve  conviction  under  the  Benami   Transactions  (Prohibition)  Act,  1988.   \\nPersonal  Income  Tax   \\n161.  Coming  to  Personal  Income  Tax  Rates,  I  have  two  announcements  to   make  for  those  opting  for  the  new  tax  regime.  First,  the  standard  deduction   for  salaried  employees  is  proposed  to  be  increased  from  ₹ 50,000/-  to'),\n",

Similarly,  deduction  on  family  pension  for  pensioners  is  proposed   to  be  enhanced  from  ₹  15,000/-  to  ₹  25,000/-.  This  will  provide  relief  to   about  four  crore  salaried  individuals  and  pensioners.  29   \\n162.  Second,  in  the  new  tax  regime,  the  tax  rate  structure  is  proposed  to   be  revised,  as  follows:   \\n0-3  lakh  rupees   Nil  \\n3-7  lakh  rupees   5  per  cent  \\n7-10  lakh  rupees   10  per  cent  \\n10-12  lakh  rupees   15  per  cent  \\n12-15  lakh  rupees   20  per  cent  \\nAbove  15  lakh  rupees   30  per  cent    As  a  result  of  these  changes,  a  salaried  employee  in  the  new  tax  regime   stands  to  save  up  to  ₹  17,500/-  in  income  tax.   \\n163.  Apart  from  these,  I  am  also  making  some  other  changes  as  given  in   the  annexure.   \\n164.  As  a  result  of  these  proposals,  revenue  of  about  ₹  37,000  crore  –   ₹  29,000  crore  in  direct  taxes  and  ₹  8,000  crore  in  indirect  taxes  –  will  be   forgone  while  revenue  of  about  ₹  30,000  crore  rupees  will  be  additionally   mobilized.  Thus,  the  total  revenue  forgone  is  about  ₹  7,000  crore  annually.   \\n165.
